# datashare_AA_COP_tweets
A temporal analysis of tweets related to the annual COP climate change negotiations. #cop26, #cop25, etc
Created for a Text Mining class as part of a Master's in Business Analytics program.

I created a RISE presentation for this project â€” viewable either through the python notebook or via the html file COP_Analysis_SentimentAnalysis_Submission.slides.html

The code is definitely not perfect. For instance I could not get a function to work that would let me streamline analyzing the sentiment by topic group for each day of the conference (you'll see my attempt at that code commented out). I think I was close to the solution on it, but just ran out of time. 

The two files you'll want to review for this project are:
1) COP_analysis_scraping_tweets  (scraping the tweets and saving to csv files)
2) COP_analyis_sentimentanalysis_submission  (LDA and sentiment analysis)

The _LexExpansion file is an attempt at a lexical expansion-focused analysis that is incomplete and not part of the final product. 


## Instructor Feedback
Nice work on the write up and organization of your README. All your work in the analysis file is strong. I love the topic chart and the sentiment analysis over time chart. As we discussed in the LDA, these are really nice groups and interpretation.

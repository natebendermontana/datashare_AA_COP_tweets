# datashare_AA_COP_tweets
A temporal analysis of tweets related to the annual COP climate change negotiations. #cop26, #cop25, etc

## 12/17 for John:

Note, I created a RISE presentation for this project â€” viewable either through the python notebook or via the html file COP_Analysis_SentimentAnalysis_Submission.slides.html

The code is definitely not perfect. For instance I could not get a function to work that would let me streamline analyzing the sentiment by topic group for each day of the conference (you'll see my attempt at that code commented out). I think I was close to the solution on it, but just ran out of time. 

Overall I'm fairly happy with the code and analysis and hope it meets your expectations. 

The two files you'll want to review for this project are:
1) COP_analysis_scraping_tweets  (scraping the tweets and saving to csv files)
2) COP_analyis_sentimentanalysis_submission  (LDA and sentiment analysis)

The _LexExpansion file is an attempt at a lexical expansion-focused analysis that is incomplete and not part of the final product. 

## Feedback

Nice work on the write up and organization of your README. All your work in the analysis file is strong. I love the topic chart and the sentiment analysis over time chart. As we discussed in the LDA, these are really nice groups and interpretation.
